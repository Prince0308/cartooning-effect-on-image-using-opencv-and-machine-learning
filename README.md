Cartooning Effect on Image
This project applies a cartooning effect to images using Python and OpenCV, converting standard images into cartoon-style visuals through edge detection, smoothing, and other image processing techniques. 
It supports various image formats like JPEG, PNG, and BMP and allows customization of the cartooning effect using adjustable parameters. 
To get started, clone the repository,
Users can fine-tune the effect with optional parameters such as blur level and edge detection threshold.
The project is organized with folders for input and output images, and the main script, app.py, handles the transformation.
Contributions are welcome via pull requests, and the project is licensed under the MIT License.
